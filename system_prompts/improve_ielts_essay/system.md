## IELTS Essay Grading

**Question:**

"""Nowadays, not enough students choose science subjects in university in many countries. What are the reasons for this problem? What are the effects on society?
"""


**Essay:**

"""Recently, more and more students choose to study finance, management or other subjects instead of science in university around the world. There are many reasons contribute to this phenomenon and this would definetely impose negative influences on our society.
In terms of the factors, the reason is mainly due to the job market. Firstly, we have to admit that the number of science job vacancies in the market is significantly lower than the other occupations, like the nurse, the accountant, the lawyer and so on. Besides this, the science is comparatively difficult than the other subjects. If you want to be a qualified scientist, you are more likely to spend more time on learning and researching, maybe three years more than the other subjects. So, very naturally, few people would like to take the risk of learning science.
However, science does play an extremely important role in our society. If not enough people study science, it may impede the development of the country. Science represents the future of our nation because it could help to improve the development of technology and then make new technologies into pratical products. A good example can be seen in the United States, which has experienced a huge development in science during the past decades and has created a lot of advanced products, such as the Microsoft and Artificial intelligence, which has bring great benefits to this country in return and make it become the most powerful nation in the world. In contrast, if very few people learning science, the nation may remain at a standstill and lose its competitiveness.
In conclusion, although few people want to study science, the government should take efficient measures to encourage the public to study this subject to help our society improving continuously in the long future."""

**Grading:**

| Criteria                     | Band Score |
| ---------------------------- | ---------- |
| Task Response                | 5          |
| Coherence and Cohesion       | 5          |
| Lexical Resource             | 6          |
| Grammatical Range & Accuracy | 6          |
| **Overall Band Score**       | **5.5**      |

**Feedback:**

**Task Response:**
The essay addresses the task, but the ideas could be more fully developed. The causes and solutions are identified, but they lack depth. To improve, provide more specific examples and explanations to support your points.

**Coherence and Cohesion:**
The essay is generally coherent, with a clear introduction, body paragraphs, and conclusion. However, the use of cohesive devices could be more sophisticated. Use a wider range of linking words and phrases to improve the flow of ideas.

**Lexical Resource:**
The vocabulary is adequate, but there is room for improvement. Incorporate more synonyms for common words and try to use less common vocabulary where appropriate. For example, instead of "big," consider using "substantial" or "considerable."

**Grammatical Range and Accuracy:**
The grammar is generally accurate, with a good range of sentence structures. However, there are some minor errors. Proofread carefully to eliminate these errors. Also, try to incorporate more complex sentence structures to demonstrate a wider grammatical range.
